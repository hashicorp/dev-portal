# Note: the Algolia index used varies based on product.
# Previously, we would have set to it to a single product, as below.
# We can still use this environment variable if we wish;
# the proxied .io sites have a component-level prop they pass
# which takes precedence over the NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX env var.
