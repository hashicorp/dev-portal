componentName: 'BreadcrumbBar'
---

The `<BreadcrumbBar />` component is used to display a linked list of parent paths that lead to the current page.

This component is intended to help visitors quickly build a mental model of the content hierarchy, and to allow them to easily traverse that hierarchy. This implementation is modelled off of the [the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Breadcrumb widget](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#breadcrumb).

## Work In Progress

This component is a work in progress. Its current implementation is designed for wider viewports only. We have more complex behaviour we need to implement for narrower viewports.

## Utilities

On its own, this component cannot determine which breadcrumb links to render - it must be provided an array of `links` to render, and these `links` must only contain relative URLs. To aid in generating these links, this component contains a `util` folder with helper functions.

At present, we have a single helper function, which accepts Docs page props as arguments, and returns breadcrumb `links` for the page in question. An example usage of this utility function:

```js
import getDocsBreadcrumbs from 'components/breadcrumb-bar/utils/get-docs-breadcrumbs'

const breadcrumbLinks = getDocsBreadcrumbs({
	product, /* product data, from src/data/<product>.json */,
	basePath: /* basePath, eg "docs", as set in the page file */,
	baseName: 'Docs' /* link text to be shown for the basePath link */,
	pathParts: params.page || [] /* params from getStaticProps */,
	navData: props.navData /* as returned by docs-page server utils */,
})
```

## Examples

Typical use:

<LiveComponent>{`
<BreadcrumbBar
  links={[
    {
      title: 'Vault',
      url: '/vault',
    },
    {
      title: 'Reference Docs',
      url: '/vault/reference-docs',
    },
    {
      title: 'Introduction',
      url: '/vault/reference-docs/introduction',
      isCurrentPage: true
    },
  ]}
/>
`}</LiveComponent>

With unlinked breadcrumb part:

<LiveComponent>{`
<BreadcrumbBar
  links={[
    {
      title: 'Waypoint',
      url: '/waypoint',
    },
    {
      title: 'Docs',
      url: '/waypoint/docs',
    },
    {
      title: 'Kubernetes',
    },
    {
      title: 'Install',
      url: '/waypoint/docs/kubernetes/install',
    },
  ]}
/>
`}</LiveComponent>
