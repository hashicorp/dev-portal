componentName: 'BreadcrumbBar'

The `<BreadcrumbBar />` component is used to display a list of parent paths that lead to the current page. This component is intended to help visitors quickly build a mental model of the content hierarchy, and to allow them to easily traverse that hierarchy.

## Work In Progress

This component is a work in progress. Its current implementation is designed for wider viewports only. We have more complex beahviour we need to implement for narrower viewports.

## Examples

<LiveComponent>{`
<BreadcrumbBar
  links={[
    {
      title: 'Vault',
      url: '/vault',
    },
    {
      title: 'Reference Docs',
      url: '/vault/reference-docs',
    },
    {
      title: 'Introduction',
      url: '/vault/reference-docs/introduction',
    },
  ]}
/>
`}</LiveComponent>
