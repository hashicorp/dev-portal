componentName: 'OutlineNav'
---

The `<OutlineNav />` component renders a `<nav />` with a vertical list of links. It is intended for jump link navigation.

<LiveComponent>
	{`<OutlineNav items={[
	{ title: 'Hello 1', url: '#hello1' },
	{ title: 'Hello 2', url: '#hello2' },
	{
		title: 'Hello 3',
		url: '#hello3',
		isActive: true,
		items: [
			{ title: 'Nested 1', url: '#nested1' },
			{ title: 'Nested 2', url: '#nested2', isActive: true },
			{ title: 'Nested 3', url: '#nested3' },
		],
	},
	{ title: 'Hello 4', url: '#hello4' },
	{ title: 'This is a very long truncated list item which rather than flowing to multiple lines should be truncated and stick to one line', url: '#long-item' },
]} />`}
</LiveComponent>

## Supplementary Components

### `<OutlineNavWithActive />`

The `<OutlineNavWithActive />` component accepts an array of items similar to the base `<OutlineNav />`, but does _not_ accept `isActive` properties on the items. Instead, it uses the `use-active-section` hook to determine the currently active section on the page, and highlights `items` accordingly. Note that the `use-active-section` search is limited to only those `#hash-links` derived from the `url` of each `item`. See the `use-active-section` implementation for further details.
