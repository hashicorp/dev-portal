componentName: 'InlineTag'

> Note: this component was added ~ 2 years ago for a one-off use case.

An _experimental_ component currently used only on `/api-docs/plugins-directory` -- currently only works correctly when applied to `ul` elements.

<LiveComponent>
{`
<InlineTag title="An example tag" color="orange" />
`}
</LiveComponent>
