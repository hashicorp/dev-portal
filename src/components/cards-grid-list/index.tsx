/**
 * Displays cards in a grid. Intended for use in main content areas.
 *
 * This component has two layout modes.
 *
 * DEFAULT - MIN WIDTH MODE
 *
 * The default is "min-width" mode. In this mode, the layout for the component
 * driven by minimum width settings on card children, rather than by explicit column counts.
 *
 * The layout approach is intended to reduce brittleness, and to help ensure
 * that we never shrink cards below their desired minimum width.
 * It also opens the possibility of using this component
 * outside of our main content area, if desired.
 *
 * FIXED COLUMN LAYOUT
 *
 * In this mode, the layout for the component is based on fixed column counts.
 * Passing an integer 1-3 to the `fixedColumnLayout` prop will use this mode,
 * and will set the maximum column count on large viewports. Note that
 * the media-queries used to change the column count are fixed. This makes
 * fixed column mode slightly more brittle than min-width mode.
