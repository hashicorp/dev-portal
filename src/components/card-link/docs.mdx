</CardLink>
`}</LiveComponent>

## Examples

<AccordionDisclosure
  title="The `ariaLabel` prop"
  description="When a `CardLink`element comes into focus, and a screen reader is being used, the screen reader will present just the content of `ariaLabel`."
>

Since `CardLink` allows any kind of content to be rendered within it, the `ariaLabel` prop is required to make sure we're intentional about the screen reader experience.

<CardLink ariaLabel="Waypoint URL Service" href="/waypoint/docs/url">
	<p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
		<strong>Waypoint URL Service</strong>
	</p>
	<p style={{ marginBottom: 0, marginTop: 4 }}>
		The Waypoint URL service is a free, public service hosted by HashiCorp to
		view your deployed app.
	</p>
</CardLink>

<AccordionDisclosure
  title="The `openInNewTab` prop"
  description="The `openInNewTab` prop is useful when a `CardLink` should be opened in a new browser tab."
>

By default, `CardLink`s will not open their `href` in a new browser tab. The `openInNewTab` prop is required to change the default functionality of `CardLink`.

Click the following `CardLink` to open it in a new browser tab.

<CardLink
	ariaLabel="Waypoint URL service"
	href="/waypoint/docs/url"
	openInNewTab
>
	<p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
		<strong>Waypoint URL Service</strong>
	</p>
	<p style={{ marginBottom: 0, marginTop: 4 }}>
		The Waypoint URL service is a free, public service hosted by HashiCorp to
		view your deployed app.
	</p>
</CardLink>
