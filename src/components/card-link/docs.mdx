See `CardLink`'s <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/dev-portal/blob/main/src/components/card-link/types.ts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">types.ts file (opens in new tab)</a> for more details on the props this component exposes.

## Playground

<LiveComponent>{`
<CardLink href="/">
  I am a CardLink that goes to the home page
</CardLink>
`}</LiveComponent>

## Examples

<AccordionDisclosure
  title="The `ariaLabel` prop"
  description="The `ariaLabel` prop is useful when there is a lot of content in a `CardLink`. When the `CardLink` comes into focus, and a screen reader is being used, the screen reader will present just the content of `ariaLabel`."
>

Start up a screen reader and listen to how the following two `CardLink`s are presented. One is very verbose, and the other is much more concise. Remember that screen reader users don't just use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to navigate web pages. They can also use arrow keys to navigate between non-focusable elements in a page.

**_Without_ the `ariaLabel` prop**

<CardLink href="/waypoint/docs/url">
	<p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
		<strong>Waypoint URL Service</strong>
	</p>
	<p style={{ marginBottom: 0, marginTop: 4 }}>
		The Waypoint URL service is a free, public service hosted by HashiCorp to
		view your deployed app.
	</p>
</CardLink>

**_With_ the `ariaLabel` prop**

<CardLink ariaLabel="Waypoint URL service" href="/waypoint/docs/url">
	<p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
		<strong>Waypoint URL Service</strong>
	</p>
	<p style={{ marginBottom: 0, marginTop: 4 }}>
		The Waypoint URL service is a free, public service hosted by HashiCorp to
		view your deployed app.
	</p>
</CardLink>

<AccordionDisclosure
  title="The `openInNewTab` prop"
  description="The `openInNewTab` prop is useful when a `CardLink` should be opened in a new browser tab."
>

By default, `CardLink`s will not open their `href` in a new browser tab. The `openInNewTab` prop is required to change the default functionality of `CardLink`.

Click the following `CardLink` to open it in a new browser tab.

<CardLink
	ariaLabel="Waypoint URL service"
	href="/waypoint/docs/url"
	openInNewTab
>
	<p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
		<strong>Waypoint URL Service</strong>
	</p>
	<p style={{ marginBottom: 0, marginTop: 4 }}>
		The Waypoint URL service is a free, public service hosted by HashiCorp to
		view your deployed app.
	</p>
</CardLink>
