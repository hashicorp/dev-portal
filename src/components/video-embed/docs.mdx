# Video Embed

Powered by [React Player](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player), this component allows you to embed videos from the following hosts:

- youtube
- facebook
- soundcloud
- vimeo
- wistia
- mixcloud
- dailymotion
- twitch
- local files

## Usage

### Adding a Video to a Tutorial (Default)

Add a `video_id` and `video_host` to your Tutorial's frontmatter and it will automatically be prepended to the top of the tutorial.

```yml
name: Getting Started
video_id: uxglzsJkBJg
video_host: youtube
```

### Adding a Video Inline in a Tutorial

If you want to specify where the video is displayed within your Tutorial, include the `<VideoEmbed />` component directly. A special `video` variable is available within the body of your Markdown content, containing the URL derived from your `video_id` and `video_host`:

```mdx
<!-- Within your .mdx file, after the Front-Matter -->

### Video Example

Follow along in this video:

<!--  *video* is a constant which resolves to  'https://youtube.com/watch?v=uxglzsJkBJg' here >
<VideoEmbed url={video} />
```

You can also just pass a regular URL - for example, if you have multiple videos on one page:

```mdx
### Another Video Example

<VideoEmbed url="https://hashicorp.wistia.com/medias/abc123" />
```

### Customizing the Player

Since this component is built off on top of [React Player](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player), it can be extremely customized. You can see the full list of `Props` that the `VideoEmbed` can accept at the [React Player Readme](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player#props).

Additionally, there is a special prop - `start` - where you can set the start offset time for the video, in seconds. This works for Youtube and Wistia video URLs. It may work with other video hosts.

Example:
`<VideoEmbed url={video} start={1477} />`
