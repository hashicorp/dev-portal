 *
 * - A "moment of progress" is represented by a playState.position that is
 *   visited while playState.isPlaying is true.
 *
 * - PROGRESS_INTERVAL represents the time in milliseconds between these events
 *   being reported. It is needed to accurately report viewing progress.
 *   When a "moment of progress" is reported, we assume that the
 *   previous PROGRESS_INTERVAL of video (usually 1 second) has been viewed.
 *
 * - MAX_PLAYBACK SPEED is the maximum ratio at which the video can play.
 *   It is also needed to accurately report viewing progress in those cases
 *   where playback speed is faster than 1.0x. At 2.0x speed, for example,
 *   "moments of progress" will be reported every 1 second, but between each
 *   report, 2 seconds of video will have been watched. So, when a
 *   "moment of progress" is reported, we in fact need to assume that the
 *   previous PROGRESS_INTERVAL * MAX_PLAYBACK_SPEED has been viewed.
