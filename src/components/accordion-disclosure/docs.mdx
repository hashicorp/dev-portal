| `id`          | The `id` passed to the root container. Used to generate an `id` for the content container which is also passed to `aria-controls` on the `AccordionDisclosure` activator button.                                         | Yes       | undefined     | string    |

| `title`       | The main text label that always shows regardless of the `AccordionDisclosure`'s open/closed state. These should be descriptive of the disclosed content; labels like "Section 1" or "Section 2" is not very descriptive. | Yes       | N/A           | string    |
