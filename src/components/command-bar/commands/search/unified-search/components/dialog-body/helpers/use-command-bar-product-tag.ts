 * We've had feedback from design at least that the "product tag" interface
 * doesn't feel right within the search modal. This raises a few questions:
 *
 * - Is this genuinely a command-bar-wide setting, or are "product tag" filters
 *   something we could apply to the "Search" command only for now? (Note:
 *   I'm not even sure other "commands" (ie "settings") are implemented yet...
 *   managing the "tags" at the command bar level feels like it may have
 *   been a premature abstraction based on relatively speculative use cases).
 *
 * - In the context of search, specifically auto-filtering to a given product
 *   when in that product context, Would typing-based filters, such as
 *   `product:<productSlug>`, be preferable to the "product tag" approach?
