 * Builds a URL path to an arbitrary hit from our unified `<env>_DEVDOT_omni`

 *
 * TODO: construct urlPath from hit data,
 * use highlighted hit data I think?
 * (Reference how we do this currently for each content type, we have
 * all the same data so should be able to do the same thing here)
 *
 * Alternately, add `urlPath` to all search objects.
 * On the fence about which to do, want to time-box constructing
 * the `urlPath` client side to see how much effort it is,
 * since it feels like a better solution maybe?
 *
 * Although then won't match say `<product>/<content_type>` because
 * `product` and `content_type` are in separate properties ðŸ¤”
 * But I guess `<product> <content_type>` (space not slash)
 * would work fine as a query?
 *
 * Only disadvantage of `urlPath` in search object is it needs
 * to be updated in tandem with front-end. To address this, could
 * add a different `urlPath_<changeIdentifier>` before rolling out a
 * new feature, once the old `hit.urlPath` is no longer used then
 * migrate to it by making both values the same, and switching which
 * is used, and then once `urlPath_<changeIdentifier>` is no longer
 * used remove it completely from indexing. Complex though if URL
 * changes happen, which they're kind of expected to!
