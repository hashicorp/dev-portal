**🚧 DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION, FOR WORK IN PROGRESS ONLY 🚧**

The `DevPopover` component is intended for use with non-interactive, work-in-progress UI implementations. It renders provided children into a `button` element, and shows the provided `note` render slot in a popover when the `button` is clicked.

## Playground

<LiveComponent>{`
<DevPopover
  title="This is a dev note"
  note={
    <>
      This is a note about how this work is in progress. We're rebuilding things
      like{' '}
      <a href="https://www.waypointproject.io/docs">Waypoint&apos;s docs</a>
      , and it's helpful to be able to link out to existing work rather than have
      to fully rebuild it for demo purposes.
      <br />

      Feel free to link out to Figma files as well. For example, for our Search
      component, you can{' '}
      <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/VD7ahvXuXWJApeGnhbW4hv/Dev-Portal?node-id=1498%3A43240">
        view the revised designs in Figma
      </a>
      .

  <span
    style={{
      display: 'block',
      border: '1px solid rebeccapurple',
      padding: '0.5rem 1rem',
      borderRadius: '4px',
    }}

    This is a work in progress element! Focus and activate it, or click it for
    info.
