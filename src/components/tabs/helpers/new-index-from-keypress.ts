/**
 * Given the key just pressed,

 *
 * Return the new index that should result
 * from pressing the key in question.
 *
 * Implements the following keyboard interactions:
 * - `ArrowRight` moves the focus to the next tab
 *    If focus is on the last tab, moves focus to the first tab.
 * - `ArrowLeft` moves the focus to the previous tab
 *    If focus is on the first tab, moves focus to the last tab.
 *
 * Keyboard interaction reference:

 * And example based on that reference:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Tablist_Role#keyboard_interactions
 *
 * Note that "Home" and "End" are suggested as optional mechanisms to quickly
 * navigate to the first or last tab, respectively. Our intent in this
 * implementation is to retain the scrolling functionality of those keys.
