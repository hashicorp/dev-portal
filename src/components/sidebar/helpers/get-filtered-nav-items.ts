/**
 * A NOTE ON THIS FILE
 *
 * We still have some significant cleanup to do with our `MenuItem`
 * types. Previously, this function was intertwined with those types,
 * which made this file seem simpler on the surface, but also
 * made this function more difficult to reason about in isolation.
 *
 * This function has been revised to accept any incoming data, as long as it
 * matches the type signatures required for this function to behave as expected.
 * At the same time, we want to give consumers the ability to preserve original
 * type information in the return data they receive.
 *
 * Due to the possibility of recursive nested within the "nav branch" types
 * that this function handles, the types in this file get a little more complex
 * than we typically see in this code base.
 *
 * A high-level overview of how this works:
 * - Consumers of this function pass `L` and `B` type arguments to ensure
 *   type information of their `navItems` tree is preserved
 * - The `L` type argument represents the consumer's `L`eaf node types.
 *   Passing this argument allows the preservation of complex leaf node types.
 *   For example, in many use cases we have `href` or `fullPath` properties.
 * - The `B` type argument represents the consumer's `B`ranch node types.
 *   Passing this argument allows the preservation of complex leaf node types.
 * - The `O` type argument represents the consumer's `O`ther node types.
 * 	 These are omitted from filtering.
 * - This function builds on the provided `L` and `B` types when filtering,
 *   augmenting them with `matchesFilter` and `hasRoutesMatchingFilter` props.
 */

/**
 * Incoming types
 *
 * We expect incoming `navItems` to be either:
 * - A `NavLeaf` node (additional properties are passed by the `L` type)
 * - A `NavBranch` node (custom properties are passed by the `B` type)
 *     - Note this type requires `L` and `B` type args due to nesting
 * - An arbitrary object (such as for `heading` and `divider` nodes)
