***
* MDX content wrapper classes
***
* As we balance sometimes rendering remote MDX content (that is also rendered in
* .io sites) alongside local JSON content in `/${productSlug}/docs` (both of
* which are authorable), we may find it necessary to customize parts of the MDX
* content.
*
* An example that likely applies to every product we want to render MDX content
* for: hiding the first <h1> element. This is because we have a custom <h1>
* element for this page that:
*   1) renders in a different part of the DOM
*   2) has auto-generated text.
*
* This is very brittle in the short term considering we don't have strong
* control over the MDX content in this repo; however, the long term goal should
* be that the MDX content comes to this repo as we need it. When that happens,
* none of the `visibility: hidden` properties should be needed. (It may be
* reasonable that we still need some custom MDX wrappers, but hopefully not
* unique for each product.)
