 * Given a fileString representing an OpenAPI schema specification,

 *
 * Note that there are multiple possible versions of OpenAPI schemas we
 * may receive as input here. We use the `oas-normalize` package to
 * convert the input to the latest version, and then dereference the
 * schema to resolve any `$ref` references.
 *
 * TODO: not sure if we're actually handling circular references here.
 * This is something we'll likely need to look into for Waypoint API docs.
 * Task: https://app.asana.com/0/1202097197789424/1203989531295664/f
 *
 * The input OpenAPI specification can be in any of the following versions:
 * - OpenAPI 2.0 (formerly known as Swagger)
 * - OpenAPI 3.0
 *
 * Note as well  that the terminology associated with OpenAPI can be confusing.
 * From the OpenAPI website:
 * OpenAPI refers to the specification itself.
 * Swagger refers to tooling for implementing the specification.
 *
 * However, this isn't always consistent, and Swagger is often used to refer
 * to the specification as well, as that's how it was known for version 2.0.

	 *
	 * For context, in OpenAPI schemas, there are often pointers or references
	 * to shared definitions within the schema. In JSON, these might look like:
	 *
	 * "schema": {
	 * 		"$ref": "#/definitions/..."
	 * }
	 *
	 * Example: https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-specs/blob/e65c7e982b65ce408ab7e456049a4bf3d5fa7ce0/specs/cloud-vault-secrets/preview/2023-06-13/hcp.swagger.json#L28
	 *
	 * With the full schema file available, these references can be resolved
	 * by looking up the referenced definition and replacing the reference.
	 * For our purposes, it seems preferable to resolve these references
	 * so that we can pass data to presentational components that do not need
	 * to be aware of the full schema file in order to render the data.
	 * After de-referencing, the schema might look like:
	 *
	 * "schema": {
	 * 		"type": "object",
	 * 		"properties": {
	 * 			"some-referenced-stuff": "..."
	 * 		}
	 * }
