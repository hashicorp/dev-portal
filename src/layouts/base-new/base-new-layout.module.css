/*

NOTE:

--navigation-header-height is currently a magicky numbers.
These are necessary for correct positioning in SidebarSidecarLayout.

These values could change based on user preferences for font-size or zoom,
but we won't know, and our design will break.

We may be able to mitigate this by refactoring --navigation-header-height
to be in `rem`, and then setting that value as the explicit CSS height
in the navigation bar component (with overflow visible perhaps).
