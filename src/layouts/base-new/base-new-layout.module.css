/*

NOTE:

--navigation-header-height and --alert-bar-height are currently magicky numbers.
These are necessary for correct positioning in SidebarSidecarLayout.

These values could change based on user preferences for font-size or zoom,
but we won't know, and our design will break.

To mitigate this, we observe the height of the .header element in this layout,
and set --sticky-bars-height to match. This would eliminate the need
for both --navigation-header-height and --alert-bar-height.
