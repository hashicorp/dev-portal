# `@hashicorp/platform-docs-mdx`

ðŸš¨ _PLEASE NOTE_: the files in this folder have been localized from our [`@hashicorp/platform-docs-mdx` package](https://github.com/hashicorp/web-platform-packages/tree/main/packages/docs-mdx). The rationale for localizing these files, rather than making upstream changes in the platform-mdx package, is:

1. The changes we want to make are intended for our experimentation in `dev-portal` only, not for wider release
2. The current consumers of `@hashicorp/platform-docs-mdx`, being all `docs` sites as well as `learn`, will both be migrated into the `dev-portal` project, making the future need for a separate `mdx` package less relevant.
