export default function SomeDevPortalRoute(): React.ReactElement {

      <h1>Welcome to some DEV PORTAL route.</h1>
      <p>
        If you&apos;re seeing this on a test product site, ie Waypoint,
        it&apos;s because there isn't a rewrite that replaces it. Maybe this is
        okay? But really we should probably redirect to the proper dev-portal
        domain?
