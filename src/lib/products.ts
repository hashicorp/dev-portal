/**
 * A map of product slugs to their proper noun names.
 *
 * ðŸš¨ NOTE: the order of the keys in this object matters. It determines
 * the order in which products are displayed in certain locations.
 * The inclusion of product slugs in this map also has many side effects.
 * Specifically, we iterate over the `Object.keys()` of this object
 * in the following places:
 *
 * LANDING PAGE RELATED USES (assumes link to `/<product>`)
 * - generate-top-level-sub-nav-items.ts (all "mobile" menus)
 * - getAllProductsNavItems (home page and old products dropdown)
 * - PRODUCT_LINK_CARDS (for 404 pages)
 * - <Chiclets /> (used on the home page)
 *
 * DOCS-RELATED USES (assumes link to `/<product>/docs`)
 * - getStaticPaths (for `/<product>/docs` landing pages)
 * - warm-cache.ts - warmDeveloperDocsCache (relates to /<product>/docs)
 * - normalizeRemoteLoaderSlug (relates to /<product>/docs)
 * - rewrite-tutorial-links.test.ts (devDotDocsPath)
 * - getProductUrlAdjuster - this was intended for use during migration, after
 *   which MDX content would be updated to avoid having to rewrite links. The
 *   MDX content rewrite never happened, i think cause versioned docs made it
 *   seem impossible to execute in a reasonable way. So, authors still write
 *   links as if the content exists on dot-io domains. The root issue here is
 *   something that'll hopefully be much easier to fix once we've migrated
 *   content to `hashicorp/web-unified-docs`. In the meantime, it'd probably
 *   still be worth it to use a more specific dot-io-targeted variable.
 * - rewrite-docs-url.test.ts (tests getProductUrlAdjuster)
 *
 * TUTORIAL-RELATED USES (assumes link to `/<product>/tutorials`)
 * - warm-cache.ts - anonymous function (relates to tutorialUrls)
 * - VALID_PRODUCT_SLUGS_FOR_FILTERING (for Tutorials Library sidebar filter)
 *    - via productSlugsToNames, really only uses slugs
 * - getTutorialLandingPaths (for tutorials included in the sitemap)
 * - getStaticPaths (for individual [...tutorialSlug] pages)
 * - generateProductTutorialHomePaths (for /<product>/tutorials landing pages)
 * - rewrite-tutorial-links.test.ts (devDotTutorialsPath)
 *
 * TYPE ASSERTION USES
 * - isProductSlug - this feels like it might be used as generic assertion
 *   across content types. It might be helpful to create more specific type
 *   guards, eg `isProductSlugWithLogo`, `isProductSlugWithDocs`,
 *   `isProductSlugWithLandingPage`, `isProductSlugWithTutorials`,
 *   `isProductSlugWithIntegrations`, etc.
 *
 * LEGACY DOT-IO MIGRATION USES (assumes a dot-io site existed for the product)
 * - getIsRewriteableDocsLink (and related tests)
 * - rewrite-tutorial-links tests ("Links to .io home pages are not rewritten")
 *
 * We already have at least one instance (for HCP Vault secrets) where we've
 * avoided adding to this constant because of how it's intertwined with other
 * purposes. It probably makes sense for us to refactor some code so that we're
 * only ever using this constant as a way to get the product name from a given
 * product slug (where "product slug" is any valid product slug across any
 * use case).
 *
 * For all other uses cases, it might feel duplicative, but one approach might
 * be to explicitly declare new constants for each use case. Or maybe, since
 * much of these use cases rely on data that could be encoded in our existing
 * `src/data/<product>.json` files, we'd could gather everything related to
 * each product in those files, and derive the maps we need from the already
 * exported `PRODUCT_DATA_MAP`. Or maybe there's some other approach that we
 * could use to simplify our setup... It feels a bit convoluted right now.
