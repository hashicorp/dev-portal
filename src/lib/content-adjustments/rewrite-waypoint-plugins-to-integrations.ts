/**
 * Rewrite Waypoint `plugin` links to `integrations`.
 *
 * Waypoint /plugins have been moved to /integrations. We have redirects
 * set up to handle this, and we hope to update these links in content,
 * but as a temporary solution we can rewrite these links at compile time.
 *
 * Note: we intentionally run this _after_ URLs have been normalized to
 * include their product prefix. This way, regardless of whether Waypoint
 * content authors are writing `/plugins` or `/waypoint/plugins`, we should
 * apply the `plugins` â†’ `integrations` rewrites correctly.
 *
 * TODO: We can remove this at some point.
 * https://app.asana.com/0/1203792616809419/1203879536690933
 *
 * It'll likely make sense once we've cleaned up old links in content.
 * The vast majority of these links are in the `hashicorp/waypoint` repo.
 * To view all places we link `/waypoint/plugins`:
 * - Within `hashicorp/waypoint`, these URLs would be written as `/plugins`.
 *   Code Search: https://cs.github.com/?scopeName=All+repos&scope=&q=repo%3Ahashicorp%2Fwaypoint+path%3A*.mdx+%22%2Fplugins%22
 * - In other repos, these URLs would be written as either
 *   waypoint.io/plugins, or developer.hashicorp.com/waypoint/plugins.
