/**
 * Rewrite Waypoint `plugin` links to `integrations`.
 *
 * Waypoint /plugins have been moved to /integrations. We have redirects
 * set up to handle this, and we hope to update these links in content,
 * but as a temporary solution we can rewrite these links at compile time.
 *
 * Note: we intentionally run this _after_ URLs have been normalized to
 * include their product prefix. This way, regardless of whether Waypoint
 * content authors are writing `/plugins` or `/waypoint/plugins`, we should
 * apply the `plugins` â†’ `integrations` rewrites correctly.
 *
 * TODO: We can remove this at some point.
