/**
 * TODO: MAY be needed for migrating `hashicorp/packer` to UNIFIED DOCS
 *
 * Packer plugins are fetched from remote repositories. We have since migrated
 * away from Packer plugins, instead using our Integrations setup... but I'm
 * not 100% sure that the migration from "plugins" to "integrations" was
 * fully complete.
 *
 * If the migration _was_ fully complete, then we should be able to deprecate
 * and completely remove the `views/packer-plugins`, which is the only consumer
 * of `shim-remote-includes`, which in turn is the only consumer of this
 * function.
 *
 * It the migration was _not_ fully complete, then we need to figure out how
 * to handle this use case before migrating Packer to UNIFIED DOCS. One path
 * forward may be to fully finish the Plugins â†’ Integrations migration.
