# HashiCorp Developer: Authorable Content

This folder contains the authorable, marketing-style content for various landing pages in HashiCorp Developer:

- [Sidebar "Resources" section](#1-additional-sidebar-resources-section-navigation-items)
- [Home Page](#2-home-page)
- [Product landing pages](#3-product-landing-pages)
- [Product Docs landing pages](#4-product-docs-landing-pages)
- [Product Install landing pages](#5-product-install-landing-pages)

## 1. Additional Sidebar "Resources" section navigation items

The Sidebar "Resources" section has a number of navigation items automatically generated for each product ([see the `generateResourcesNavItems` Sidebar helper](/src/components/sidebar/helpers/generate-resources-nav-items.ts)). To add _additional_ navigation items to the "Resources" section of the Sidebar:

1. Open the folder of the Product you'd like to make changes for
2. Open (or create) the `additional-sidebar-resources.json` file
3. Reference the next subsection for details on what is authorable

### Editing additional "Resources" navigation items

The `additional-sidebar-resources.json` file should contain a single array. Each item in the array should be an object. Each object should have two properties:

1. `title` (string): This is the text shown for the navigation item.
2. `href` (string): This is the destination of the navigation item. If it is an external link, the Sidebar will automatically render an external link icon to the right of the `title` text.

## 2. Home Page

To change the content for [the Home page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/):

1. Open the `home-page.json` file
2. Reference the next subsection for deatils on what is authorable

### Editing Home Page content

TODO

## 3. Product landing pages

To change the content for Product landing pages (e.g. [/vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault), [/waypoint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/waypoint)):

1. Open the folder of the Product you'd like to make changes for
2. Open the `product-landing.json` file
3. Reference the next subsection for details on what is authorable

### Editing Product landing content

These pages take a "block"-based authoring approach for the main content area. This approach allows authors to write content in JSON instead of JSX. As an overview, each file has three properties, all are required : `heading`, `subheading`, `blocks`. Each of these top-level properties is addressed in more detail below.

<details>
<summary><code>heading</code> and <code>subheading</code></summary>

Source:

```json5
{
	heading: 'Waypoint Documentation',
	subheading: 'Use Waypoint to deliver a PaaS-like experience for Kubernetes, ECS, and other platforms.',
	blocks: [
		/* ... */
	],
}
```

Result:

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>blocks</code></summary>

Each item in the `blocks` array represents a component on the page. Each of these items must have a `type` property, which can be one of the types listed below.

<!-- block: type heading -->

<details>
<summary>Block type: <code>"heading"</code></summary>

Heading blocks render HTML heading elements using [our Heading component](../components/heading/index.tsx). Each block accepts the following properties:

| Property  | Type                                                                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `heading` | `string`                                                            | Text for the heading                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `level`   | [`2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5 \| 6`](../components/heading/types.ts)           | Semantic heading level, for example `2` becomes `<h2>`. Note that there is already an `<h1>` rendered for the page, so only these values should be used.                                                     |
| `size`    | [`100 \| 200 \| 300 \| 400 \| 500`](../components/heading/types.ts) | Visual size of the heading. `500` is the largest size and `100` is the smallest. Visual size should generally reflect the semantic level, with `h2 = 300`, `h3 = 200`, and `h4` and below at the `100` size. |

Example: `h2` with `300` size:

```json5
{
	type: 'heading',
	heading: 'Featured Reference Docs',
	level: 2,
	size: 300,
}
```

Example: `h2` with `400` size:

```json5
{
	type: 'heading',
	heading: 'Explore Waypoint Documentation',
	level: 2,
	size: 400,
}
```

<!-- block type: get_started -->

<details>
<summary>Block type: <code>"get_started"</code></summary>

The `"get_started"` block renders a heading, descriptive text, and a single link alongside a product icon.

## 4. Product Docs landing pages

To change the content for Product Tutorials landing pages (e.g. [/vault/docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs), [/waypoint/docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/waypoint/docs)):

1. Open the folder of the Product you'd like to make changes for
2. Open the `docs-landing.json` file
3. Reference the next subsection for details on what is authorable

### Editing Docs landing content

<details>
<summary>🚨 Important Note about <code>mdxSlot</code></summary>

Some products also render MDX content in addition to the content specified in `marketingContentBlocks`. MDX content shows up very last in the page content. It can be authored in the product's repository, in the same file that was previously used to populate the content of these pages.

- For example, Waypoint's MDX content for this page can be edited at: [`hashicorp/waypoint`](hashicorp/waypoint) GitHub repository in the [`website/content/docs/index.mdx` file](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/blob/main/website/content/docs/index.mdx).
- It is also important to note that to enable rendering MDX content in this view, `includeMDXSource: true` must be passed as an option to the `generateGetStaticProps` function exported from [`src/views/product-root-docs-path-landing/server`](/src/views/product-root-docs-path-landing/server.ts). See [`src/pages/waypoint/docs/index`](/src/pages/waypoint/docs/index.tsx) for example of how this is done.

</details>

These files allow the following properties at the top-level: `pageSubtitle` and `marketingContentBlocks`. These are documented below.

<details>
<summary><code>pageSubtitle</code></summary>

The `pageSubtitle` property is used to customize the text beneath the page title.

- The page title is automatically generated and reads "${ProductName} Documentation", for example: "Waypoint Documentation".
- The page title and subtitle are both placed to the right of an [`IconTileLogo`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/swingset/components/icontilelogo). This is something to be mindful of when determining the character length of the subtitle.

The following configuration:

```json
{
	"pageSubtitle": "Learn and develop your knowledge of Waypoint with these tutorials and code resources."
}
```

Outputs the following:

![Full window screenshot showing the example `pageSubtitle` text beneath the page heading.](/docs/images/ProductRootDocsPathLanding-pageSubtitle.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>marketingContentBlocks</code></summary>

This property is an array of objects. Each object has properties that express what type of content block should be rendered. There are currently three types of blocks for this view. Listed in alphabetical order:

<!-- START OF card-grid DESCRIPTION -->

<details>
<summary>the <code>card-grid</code> block type</summary>

The `card-grid` block type handles rendering two things:

1. a grid of clickable cards
2. a heading element that labels the grid of cards

A `card-grid` block has three properties: `title`, `description`, and `cards`.

- `title` (required): plain text that will be rendered inside of a heading element. The level of the heading element will be automatically generated based on other blocks defined in `marketingContentBlocks`.
- `description` (optional): plain text to show after the heading element and before the grid of cards.
- `cards` (required): an array of objects. Each object must have the following properties:
  - `title`: plain text used to label a card with bold text.
  - `description`: plain text used to describe the linked content. This text is automatically ellipsed to take up a maxium of 3-lines.
  - `url`: where the user will be taken when they click the card.

The following configuration:

```json
{
	"marketingContentBlocks": [
		{
			"type": "card-grid",
			"title": "Secrets Management",
			"description": "Centrally store, access, and deploy secrets across applications, systems, and infrastructure.",
			"cards": [
				{
					"description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.",
					"title": "KV Secrets Engine",
					"url": "/vault/docs/secrets/kv"
				},
				{
					"description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.",
					"title": "Database Credentials",
					"url": "/vault/docs/secrets/databases"
				},
				{
					"description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.",
					"title": "Kubernetes Secrets",
					"url": "/vault/tutorials/kubernetes"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

Will output the following:

![Zoomed in view of a `card-grid` block. The first row is a heading element that reads "Secrets Management". The second row is body text that reads "Centrally store, access, and deploy secrets across applications, systems, and infrastructure." The third row shows 3 cards. Each card has a bold title: "Kv Secrets Engine", "Database Credentials", and "Kubernetes Secrets". Below each card title is lorem-ipsum body text with ellipses at the end of the third line of content.](/docs/images/ProductRootDocsPathLanding-marketingContentBlocks-card-grid.png)

</details>

<!-- END OF card-grid DESCRIPTION -->

<!-- START OF icon-card-grid DESCRIPTION -->

<details>
<summary>the <code>icon-card-grid</code> block type</summary>

The `icon-card-grid` block type is similar to the `card-grid` block type in that it renders a grid of clickable cards. The `icon-card-grid` block does not have a `title` property for rendering a heading element, and the main difference between the two blocks is the content rendered in the cards.

An `icon-card-grid` block has one property:

- `cards` (required): an array of objects. Each object must have the following properties:
  - `iconName`: the string name for a Flight icon. The icons currently supported in this block can be found in [the `supported-icons.tsx` file](./components/supported-icons.tsx) All icon names can be found at [flight-hashicorp.vercel.app](https://flight-hashicorp.vercel.app/).
  - `text`: a brief string labeling the card.
  - `url`: where the user will be taken when the click the card.

The following configuration:

```json
{
  "type": "section-heading",
  "title": "Developers"
},
{
  "type": "icon-card-grid",
  "cards": [
    {
      "iconName": "guide",
      "text": "Client Libraries",
      "url": "/vault/api-docs/libraries"
    },
    {
      "iconName": "tools",
      "text": "API Reference",
      "url": "/vault/api-docs"
    },
    {
      "iconName": "connection",
      "text": "Sample Integrations",
      "url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/hello-vault-go"
    },
    {
      "iconName": "terminal",
      "text": "Code Samples",
      "url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-examples"
    }
  ]
}
```

Will output the following:

The `section-heading` content block always renders an `<h2>` element. It should be used to label a new section of content. There is currently only one property to provide for this block:

- `title`: the text to place in the rendered `h2` element.

Notes on intended usage:

- Since the `card-grid` block has a heading element built in to its configuration, it is not necessary to use a `section-heading` with a singular `card-grid` block.
- If there are multiple, related `card-grid` blocks being rendered in a group, the group can be labeled with a single `section-heading` block. The heading elements rendered for the `card-grid` blocks will be automatically determined to be `<h3>` elements.

Example usage:

```json
{
	"type": "section-heading",
	"title": "Developers"
}
```

### Editing Install landing content

There are four possible data properties that can be provided at the highest level: `doesNotHavePackageManagers`, `featuredTutorials`, `packageManagerOverrides`, and `sidebarMarketingCard`.

<!-- doesNotHavePackageManagers -->

<details>
<summary><code>doesNotHavePackageManagers</code></summary>

This is an optional `boolean` property used for specifying if a product's downloads page should show package managers for each operating system. It only needs to be specified if no package managers need to be shown.

Example usage:

```json
{
	"doesNotHavePackageManagers": true
}
```

</details>

<!-- featuredTutorials -->

<details>
<summary><code>featuredTutorialsSlugs</code></summary>

This property is an array of strings. It is used to render many `TutorialCard` elements under a "Featured Tutorials" heading.

There are two accepted formats for the slugs:

- `:productSlug/:tutorialSlug`: If you'd like to link to the tutorial's default collection, use this shorter slug format.
- `:productSlug/:collectionSlug/:tutorialSlug`: If you'd like to link to the tutorial in a collection that is not its default, use this longer slug format. **The order of the slugs matters.**

</details>

<!-- packageManagerOverrides -->

<details>
<summary><code>packageManagerOverrides</code></summary>

This is an array of objects. There is a default list of package managers that is shown for every product (see the `generateDefaultPackageManagers` helper in [`ProductDownloadsView`](../views/product-downloads-view/helpers.ts)). This property can be used to override any of the default package managers based on the `os` and `label` properties provided.

Example usage showing an override for macOS Homebrew:

```json
{
	"packageManagerOverrides": [
		{
			"label": "Homebrew",
			"commands": ["brew install vagrant"],
			"os": "darwin"
		}
	]
}
```

</details>

<!-- sidecarMarketingCard -->

<details>
<summary><code>sidecarMarketingCard</code></summary>

This is an object for the marketing content located in a `Card` in the Sidecar of the downloads view.

- `title`: The title of the card, shown in a heavier weight font
- `subtitle`: The subtitle of the card, shown in a normal weight font
- `featuredDocsLinks`: An array of objects with the following properties:
  - `href`: The internal path to a documentation page
  - `label`: The text to show for the link

</details>
