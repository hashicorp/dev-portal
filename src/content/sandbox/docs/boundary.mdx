<Warning>
  
This environment is not production-ready as it does not follow our recommendations for production-ready cluster deployments. Please refer to the <a href="/boundary/docs/install-boundary">Install Boundary</a> documentation and the <a href="/boundary/tutorials/enterprise/ent-deployment-guide">Boundary Enterprise Deployment Guide</a> pages for more information.

This is a development and testing environment. It provides the learner an opportunity to interact with a Boundary Community Edition cluster, and sets up a target the learner can configure for access using Boundary. This environment can serve as a companion to the documentation, or a place to experiment with the product.

</Warning>

**Overview**
The Boundary cluster contains one controller server and one worker, each with Boundary installed and running. A PostgreSQL database is running on the Boundary controller.

The Boundary target is an Ubuntu 24.04 server with the openssh-server and postgresql-server packages installed. SSH is configured to allow for password access for the following users:

- Danielle:
  - username: `danielle`
  - password: `danielle_password`
- Oliver:
  - username: `oliver`
  - password: `oliver_password`
- Steve:
  - username: `steve`
  - password: `steve_password`

This sandbox also configures a postgres database that is available on port `5432`:

- name: `northwind`
  - username: `postgres`
  - password: `postgres`

**Access the Boundary Admin UI**

You can log in to the Boundary Admin UI in the tab named `Boundary Admin UI`. You can switch to the `Boundary Admin UI` tab.

To log into the Boundary Admin UI, use the following credentials for the admin user:

- Username: `global-admin`
- Password: `password`

Or log in as the unprivileged user:

- Username: `user`
- Password: `password`

**Within Boundary, the following resources are configured:**

- Org: `sandbox org`
- Project: `sandbox project`
- Host Catalogs:
 - `ubuntu-target-host-catalog`
 - `controller-host-catalog`
- Credential Store:
 - `ubuntu-target-creds`
- Targets:
 - `northwind-db`
 - `ubuntu-target-ssh`
 - `boundary-db`


You can access these targets from the Boundary workstation by configuring the CLI.

**CLI Access**
The shell in the [`boundary-workstation` tab](tab-0) has the Boundary, Vault, and Terraform CLI tools installed.

The sandbox automatically sets the following environment variables:
- `BOUNDARY_ADDR=http://boundary-controller:9200`
- `VAULT_ADDR=http://vault-server:8200`

You can log into Boundary from the CLI using the admin credentials:

- Username: `global-admin`
- Password: `password`

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate
Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctpw_sC5a4GP9JA
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_CzkwJb5RRR
  Expiration Time: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 01:36:55 UTC
  User ID:         u_UURrzGLCik
The token name "default" was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

After authentication, you can connect to targets using the `boundary connect` command.
To connect to the `northwind` database on the `ubuntu-target` host:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres northwind
Credentials are being brokered but no -dbname parameter provided. psql may misinterpret another parameter as the database name.
psql (16.8 (Ubuntu 16.8-0ubuntu0.24.04.1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.
postgres=#
```

When you connect to the `ubuntu-target` host it will display the available brokered credentials for the `oliver` and `danielle` users, and automatically select one of them to log you in as. Copy and paste or type the user's password to connect:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh ubuntu-target
Credentials:
  Credential Source Description: Credentials for oliver user on ubuntu-target host
  Credential Source ID:          credup_XuqoTfBGrj

  Credential Store Type:         static

  Credential Store Type:         static

        username:   danielle

Warning: Permanently added 'hst_hi2n8ghvx8' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

```

You can also select a user to authenticate as by passing additional login
parameters to `boundary connect ssh`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh ubuntu-target -username danielle
Credentials:
  Credential Source Description: Credentials for oliver user on ubuntu-target host
  Credential Source ID:          credup_XuqoTfBGrj
  Credential Source Name:        oliver-creds
  Credential Store ID:           csst_iHuwhwzstA
  Credential Store Type:         static
  Credential Type:               username_password
  Secret:
        password:   oliver_password
        username:   oliver
  Credential Source Description: Credentials for danielle user on ubuntu-target host
  Credential Source ID:          credup_po69wMQRNN
  Credential Source Name:        danielle-creds
  Credential Store ID:           csst_iHuwhwzstA
  Credential Store Type:         static
  Credential Type:               username_password
  Secret:
        password:   danielle_password
        username:   danielle
danielle@hst_hi2n8ghvx8's password:
danielle@ubuntu-target$
```

**Vault integration**

You can optionally set up Vault to act as a credential broker for Boundary. You can access the Vault server from the Boundary workstation, where the `VAULT_ADDR=https://vault-server:8200` environment variable is set.

To learn more about setting up a Vault credential library, check out the [Vault credential brokering quickstart](/boundary/tutorials/credential-management/community-vault-cred-brokering-quickstart) tutorial.

**Troubleshooting and experimenting**

You can access the targets and databases directly without using Boundary.
For example, you can SSH into the ubuntu-target as the Oliver user:

```shell-session
$ ssh oliver@ubuntu-target
oliver@hst_hi2n8ghvx8's password:
oliver@boundary-target$
```

Or you can access the northwind database on the ubuntu-target with `psql`:

```shell-session
$ psql -h ubuntu-target -d northwind -p 5432 -U postgres
psql (16.8 (Ubuntu 16.8-0ubuntu0.24.04.1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.
postgres=#
```

This bypasses Boundary, allows you to experiment with the target configuration. Note that you do not have root access to the target or other sandboxes. You can execute `systemctl` and `journalctl` on the controller and worker servers to restart the Boundary service if you make a configuration change, and view logs.

This environment is not production-ready, as it does not follow recommendations for production cluster deployments. Refer to these resources for more information:

**Community edition**

The Boundary Sandbox uses the Boundary and Vault Community editions. This means you cannot use enterprise features here.

**TLS**

TLS is not enabled for any of the components in this sandbox environment.

**Platform limitations**

Because of the limitations of this platform:

1. All servers are located in the same network. In a real-world example, the
   Boundary control plane, target server, Vault cluster, and workstation would
   be on separate, isolated networks. The Boundary worker is then placed on the
   same network as the targets it provides access to, such as the SSH, database,
   or Vault servers in this lab.
1. All servers can be accessed directly by SSH using their hostnames, bypassing Boundary.
1. The workstation and other servers do not allow root-level access.
