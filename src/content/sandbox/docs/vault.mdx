This is a 5-node Vault Community edition cluster with a reverse proxy running in a Docker environment. This environment initializes Vault with a Shamir seal, and one unseal key for convenience and simplicity.

You can find container data, configuration, logs, and the plugins directory in the `/home/learner/sandbox-vault/containers` directory. Here are the contents of the `vault_sandbox_1` container directory as an example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```
.
├── certs
│   ├── server_cert.pem
│   ├── server_key.pem
│   └── vault_sandbox_ca.pem
├── config
│   └── server.hcl
├── logs
│   └── vault_audit.log
└── plugins
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can browse these files from the Code Editor tab as well.

If you need to directly access a container, you can use 'docker exec'. For example, to get a shell session in vault-1, use:

```shell-session
$ docker exec -i -t vault-1 sh
```

Export one of the following to address the Vault cluster node you need to communicate with (reverse proxy by default):

- `export VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8443` # Active node via reverse proxy
- `export VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8200` # Vault node 1
- `export VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8220` # Vault node 2
- `export VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8230` # Vault node 3
- `export VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8240` # Vault node 4
- `export VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8250` # Vault node 5

You can access the Vault UI for each node with the tabs labeled Vault 1 UI through Vault 5 UI.

The environment enables Vault server telemetry from the active node to Prometheus, and you can use Grafana to access a dashboard in the Grafana tab with these credentials:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `2LearnVault`

The sandbox is composed of 5 Vault Docker containers, and a reverse proxy container. Not shown are the Prometheus and Grafana containers which handle telemetry metrics.

<Tab heading="Limitations">

Vault Sandbox is a development and testing environment configured as "production-lite", and has limitations that you should be aware of.

**Not production ready**

This environment is not production-ready, as it does not follow recommendations for production cluster deployments. Refer to these resources for more information:

- [Vault with integrated storage reference architecture](/vault/tutorials/day-one-raft/raft-reference-architecture)
- [Vault with integrated storage deployment guide](/vault/tutorials/day-one-raft/raft-deployment-guide)
- [Harden server deployments](/vault/tutorials/archive/production-hardening)

**Community edition**

Be aware that Vault Sandbox uses the Vault Community edition, and this imposes the limitation that you cannot use enterprise features here.

**TLS**

Vault Sandbox features mutual TLS between cluster nodes. You should be aware that the environment dynamically generates TLS material used to enable TLS with a 24 hour time to live.

**Root token**

Vault Sandbox uses and exposes the initial root token value for ease of development and testing. You should not rely on root token use for production implementations.
