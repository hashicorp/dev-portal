## contrib Tools and Helpers

Some services and tools that Waypoint use involve some additional setup to run and manage locally.

The `contrib` folder aims to help users reduce friction around getting started using these tools locally to explore Waypoint. You can find these optional tools and content on the [Waypoint GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/tree/main/contrib).

An example of this is leveraging [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to setup a local kubernetnes cluster to install Waypoint server: [kind+k8s](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/tree/main/contrib/serverinstall/kind-k8s).

Don't see a tool here that you need to get started? Feel free to open a new enhancement request issue on GitHub, or contribute your own!

## Extending

The [plugin documentation](/plugins) describes more resources available to use in your Waypoint configuration. Contribute by writing your own plugin with this [plugin tutorial](/docs/extending-waypoint/creating-plugins).

Integrate Waypoint into your continuous delivery workflow with examples for [GitHub Actions](/docs/automating-execution/github-actions), [GitLab CI/CD](/docs/automating-execution/gitlab-cicd), [CircleCI](/docs/automating-execution/circle-ci), or [Jenkins](/docs/automating-execution/jenkins).
