## Know the GitHub account you are using.

- Use the same GitHub account every time you access your HashiCorp Certification Exam Portal.
- Check if you are logged in to GitHub in another window or tab. If incorrect, log out and switch accounts. 
- Using a different account creates a new portal with no access to your appointments, results, or credentials. 

## Use a personal email. 

- Enter your personal email as your primary contact. 
- Add your work email under "Employer Affiliation."
- Do not start over to fix mistakes. Make changes in your Exam Portal.
