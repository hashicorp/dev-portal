## Exam experience

All certification exams are taken online with a live proctor.  During your appointment, the live proctor verifies your identity, explains rules, and monitors your exam session. 

## Requirements for attending an exam

Before you register for an exam, review the [rules and requirements for taking exams](https://hashicorp-certifications.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/26234761626125). You are responsible for following these rules to join and complete your appointment. If you do not follow them, you may lose your exam fees.

## Your badge and certificate

When you pass a certification exam, HashiCorp offers a digital badge and downloadable certificate through Credly. You can use your badge in email signatures, resumes, or on social media platforms like LinkedIn. Each badge links to a real-time verification page that highlights your qualifications. This free service is [optional](https://hashicorp-certifications.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5811382524429-Public-Credential-Directory).

## Renewing Your certification

HashiCorp Certifications are valid for two years. To recertify, pass an exam for the same product at the same level or higher. You can take your recertification exam up to 6 months before your certification expires. Learn more about your [recertification options](https://hashicorp-certifications.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9677396620941-Recertification-policies-and-processes).  

## Finding certified practitioners

HashiCorp publishes earned badges to a public [Credly directory](https://www.credly.com/organizations/hashicorp/directory), where you can search for certified Cloud Engineers. Exam-takers can opt out of this service.
