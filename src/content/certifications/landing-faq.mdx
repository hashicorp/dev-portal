## Exam Experience

All certification exams are taken online with a live proctor, accommodating all locations and time zones. Online proctoring provides the same benefits of a physical test center while being more accessible to exam-takers. The live proctor verifies your identity, walks you through rules and procedures, and watches you take the exam. Learn more ways to prepare for an online proctored exam in our [Knowledgebase](https://hashicorp-certifications.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360009756751-Taking-Your-Exam).

## Requirements for Attending an Exam

Before you register for an exam, review the [Exam-taker Handbook](https://hashicorp-certifications.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048211571) to learn the requirements and policies for taking exams. It is your responsibility to know and abide by our program rules to successfully enter your exam appointment, failure to do so may result in forfeiture of appointment fees.

## Your Badge and Certificate

HashiCorp has partnered with [Credly](https://www.credly.com/organizations/hashicorp/badges) to offer you a digital badge and downloadable certificate upon passing a certification exam. There is no fee for this service and acceptance is up to you. Digital badges can be used in email signatures or digital resumes, and on social media sites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. Badges link back to a real-time verification feature that describes your qualifications.
