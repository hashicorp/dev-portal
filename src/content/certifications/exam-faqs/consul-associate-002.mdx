## Renewing Your Certification

To renew your Consul Associate certification, you will need to take and pass a Consul Associate exam.

**If you hold an *unexpired* Consul Associate certification:** You can take the exam again starting 18 months after your previous exam date. When you pass the exam, the expiration date on your credentials will be extended. You may want to wait until Consul Associate 003 is released.

**If you hold an *expired* Consul Associate certification:** You are eligible to recertify at any time. When you pass a Consul Associate exam again, you will receive a new, separate set of credentials with a new expiration date.
