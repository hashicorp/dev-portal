## Requirements for Attending an Exam

Review the [rules and policies](https://hashicorp-certifications.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/26234702018573) for taking HashiCorp certification exams.

## Renewing Your Certification

To renew your Vault Associate certification, you will need to take and pass either the Vault Associate 003 exam or the Vault Operations Professional exam.

**If you hold an *unexpired* Vault Associate 002 certification:** You can take the new (003) exam starting 18 months after your previous exam date. When you pass the exam, you will receive a new, separate set of credentials (badge and certificate) that reflect your recertification date. The expiration date of your Vault Associate 002 credentials will remain unchanged.

**If you hold an *unexpired* Vault Associate 003 certification:** You can retake the Vault Associate 003 exam starting 18 months after your previous exam date. When you pass the exam, the expiration date on your credentials will be extended.

**You can also renew any *unexpired* Vault Associate certification by passing the Vault Operations Professional exam.** This will extend the expiration date of your unexpired Vault Associate 002 or 003 certification and grant you professional-level credentials.

**If you hold any *expired* Vault Associate certification:** You are eligible to recertify at any time. When you pass the Vault Associate 003 exam, you will receive a new set of credentials with a new expiration date.
