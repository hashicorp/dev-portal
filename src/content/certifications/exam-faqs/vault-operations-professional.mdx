## Prerequisites

We strongly recommend passing the associate-level Vault exam before taking the professional-level exam. Practitioners who are already experienced with Vault operations in a production environment—and understand the concepts covered in the associate exam— may be able to successfully pass the professional-level exam.

- HashiCorp Certified: Vault Associate Certification (recommended)
- Linux skills such as list and edit files via command terminal
- Understanding of IP networking
- Experience with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), including PGP and TLS
- Information security fundamentals such as network security and RBAC
- Understand the concepts and functionality of infrastructure running in containers including starting and stopping services, and reading logs

## Lab-based Exam

This performance-based exam contains labs that must be completed in a virtual environment, and a shorter multiple-choice section. During the lab scenarios, exam-takers will be tested on performing real-world Vault operational tasks on the command line. The Vault UI and API can also be used where applicable, and exam-takers will have access to the Vault and Vault API documentation.

## Requirements for Attending an Exam
