## Prerequisites

This exam assesses both advanced configuration authoring and a deep understanding of Terraform workflows. Earning this credential reflects that the practitioner has professional-level expertise in both domains. We strongly recommend that you pass the associate-level Terraform exam before taking the professional-level exam. The professional-level exam is intended for practitioners who have extensive experience with Terraform in a production environment, and understand the concepts covered in the associate exam. 

- Experience using the Terraform AWS Provider in a production environment
- HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate Certification (recommended)
- Linux skills, such as the ability to list and edit files via command terminal
- Experience using cloud credentials 
- Familiarity with YAML, JSON, HCL, and CSV formats
- Understanding of the networking stack and networking protocols, including TCP/IP and UDP
- Advanced configuration authoring and a deep understanding of Terraform workflows

## Lab-based Exam

This performance-based exam contains labs that must be completed in a virtual environment along with a shorter multiple-choice section. During the lab scenarios, you will be tested on performing real-world Terraform tasks using the command line, cloud providers' (AWS) UI, and text editors. You will have access to Terraform documentation, AWS cloud provider documentation, and limited Registry access.
