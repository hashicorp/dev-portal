## Prerequisites

We strongly recommend passing the associate-level Terraform exam before taking the professional-level exam. Practitioners who have extensive experience with Terraform in a production environment, and understand the concepts covered in the associate exam, may be able to successfully pass the professional-level exam.

- HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate Certification (recommended)
- Linux skills such as list and edit files via command terminal
- Experience working with a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) and experience with cloud credentials 
- Familiarity with YAML, JSON, HCL, and CSV formats
- Understanding of the networking stack and networking protocols, including TCP/IP and UDP

## Lab-based Exam

This performance-based exam contains labs that must be completed in a virtual environment and a shorter multiple-choice section. During the lab scenarios, exam-takers will be tested on performing real-world Terraform tasks using the command line, cloud providers' (AWS, GCP, or Azure) UI, and text editors. Exam-takers will have access to Terraform documentation, cloud provider documentation, and limited Registry access.

## Requirements for Attending an Exam
