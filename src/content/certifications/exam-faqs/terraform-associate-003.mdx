## Which exam to take

All versions of the Terraform Associate exam validate your skills at the associate level. Version 003 is currently available, and version 004 will be available to attempt on January 8, 2026. You may hold both certifications at the same time.

## Who should take this exam 

You should take the Terraform Associate certification exam if you are a Cloud Engineer with foundational Terraform knowledge and skills. You have basic terminal skills, an understanding of on-premises and cloud architecture, and you can identify Terraform Enterprise features and distinguish them from Community Edition. While professional experience is recommended, you can also prepare by practicing the exam objectives in a personal demo setup.

## Renewing your certification

## Recertification wording option 1 (this would be deleted) 

You can renew an unexpired certification in two ways: 

### Option 1: Pass a Professional-level exam

Pass the Terraform Authoring and Operations Professional exam: 
 * Extend the expiration date of your Associate credentials 
 * Earn a new professional-level badge and certificate 

### Option 2: Pass an Associate-level exam 

The details of this option depend on the version of the exam you originally passed. Know which exam version you passed by the 3-digit code on your credentials (badge and certificate). 

* Current exam version: Terraform Associate 003 
* Retired exam version(s): Terraform Associate 002  

#### If you have credentials from the current version of the Terraform Associate exam: 

* Retake the same exam version again starting 6 months before your expiration date to extend your (003) expiration date. 
* Pass the exam to extend your credentials’ expiration.

 #### If you have credentials from a retired version of the Terraform Associate exam:  

Take the current version of the Terraform Associate exam starting 6 months before your expiration date: 
  * Receive a new, separate set of credentials that will reflect your recertification date. 
  * The expiration date of your existing Terraform Associate 002 credentials will not be updated. 

### You can renew an expired certification by passing the current version of the exam. 

* Recertify at any time by passing the current version of the Terraform Associate exam. 
* Receive a new, separate set of credentials with a new expiration date.

## Recertification wording option 2 

Understand your recertification options. Start by finding the scenario that applies to you and then evaluate your options and next steps. Know which exam version you passed by the 3-digit code on your credentials (badge and certificate). 

* Current exam version: Terraform Associate 003 
* Retired exam version(s): Terraform Associate 002 

### Scenario 1: You hold an unexpired Terraform Associate certification from a retired version of the exam. 

#### Option 1: Pass the Terraform Authoring and Operations Professional exam 

* Extend your Associate credentials' expiration date 
* Earn a new professional-level badge and certificate 

#### Option 2: Pass the current version of the Terraform Associate exam starting 6 months before expiration 

* Receive a new, separate set of credentials with a new expiration date 
* Your original credentials' expiration date is not updated 

### Scenario 2: You hold an unexpired Terraform Associate certification from the current version of the exam. 

#### Option 1: Pass the Terraform Authoring and Operations Professional exam 

* Extend your Associate credentials' expiration date 
* Earn a new professional-level badge and certificate 

#### Option 2: Pass the current version of the Terraform Associate exam starting 6 months before expiration 

* Receive a new, separate set of credentials with a new expiration date 
* Your original credentials' expiration date is not updated 

### Scenario 2: You hold an unexpired Terraform Associate certification from the current version of the exam. 

* Extend your Associate credentials' expiration date 

### Scenario 3: You hold any expired Terraform Associate certification 

_There is only one option for recertifying if your certification has already expired._ Pass the current version of the Terraform Associate exam at any time.

* Receive a new, separate set of credentials with a new expiration date 
* Your expired credentials' expiration date is not updated 

## Content differences between the (002) and (003) exams

We updated the Terraform Associate from version 002 to 003 in 2023 to account for how Terraform had grown. The changes were primarily a reorganization and rewording of the 002 exam objectives. More significant changes are listed below.

### Exam updates summary

#### Removed topics
- **3e:** Explain when to use and not use provisioners and when to use local-exec or remote-exec
- **4:** Use Terraform outside of core workflow — `terraform taint`

#### Modified or new topics
- **6b:** Initialize a Terraform working directory (`terraform init`) now includes questions about `terraform.lock.hcl`
- **7:** Implement and maintain state now includes cloud integration authentication and cloud backends 
- **8a:** Demonstrate use of variables and outputs now includes sensitive variables and outputs' relationship to exposure on the CLI
- **8g:** Configure resource using a `dynamic` block. Use cases for `dynamic` block are still tested in objective 8
- **9:** Understand HCP Terraform capabilities now accommodates the current and future state of HCP Terraform
