## Which exam to take

All versions of the Terraform Associate exam validate your skills at the associate level. Version 003 is currently available, and version 004 will be available to attempt on January 8, 2026. You may hold both certifications at the same time. 

- **Terraform Associate 003:** Available to take now.

## Who should take this exam 

You should take the Terraform Associate certification exam if you are a Cloud Engineer with foundational Terraform knowledge and skills. You have basic terminal skills, an understanding of on-premises and cloud architecture, and you can identify Terraform Enterprise features and distinguish them from Community Edition. While professional experience is recommended, you can also prepare by practicing the exam objectives in a personal demo setup.

## Content differences between the (002) and (003) exams

We updated the Terraform Associate from version 002 to 003 in 2023 to account for how Terraform had grown. The changes were primarily a reorganization and rewording of the 002 exam objectives. More significant changes are listed below.
