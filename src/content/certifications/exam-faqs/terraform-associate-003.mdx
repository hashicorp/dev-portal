## Renewing Your Certification

To renew any Terraform Associate certification, you will need to take and pass the new Terraform Associate 003 exam.

**If you hold an *unexpired* Terraform Associate 002 certification:** You can take the new (003) exam starting 18 months after your previous exam date. When you pass the Terraform Associate 003 exam to recertify, you will receive a new, separate set of credentials (badge and corresponding certificate) that will reflect your recertification date. The date of your credentials related to your Terraform Associate 002 certification will not be updated.

**If you hold an *unexpired* Terraform Associate 003 certification:** You can take the new exam starting 18 months after your previous exam date. When you pass the new exam, the expiration date on your credentials will be extended.

**If you hold any *expired* Terraform Associate certification:** You are eligible to recertify at any time. When you pass the new exam, you will receive a new, separate set of credentials with a new expiration date.

### Content Differences Between the 002 and 003 exams

We updated the Terraform Associate 003 exam to account for how Terraform has grown, and to accommodate future growth. The changes are primarily a reorganization and rewording of the 002 exam objectives. More significant changes are listed below.
