## Exam Availability Dates
- **April 5:** Terraform Associate **003** is available to schedule. Both versions are available.
- **May 5:** Last day to schedule or reschedule an appointment to take the Terraform Associate 002 exam.
    - Scheduling subject to appointment availability until May 19.

## Which Exam to Take

The Terraform Associate 002 certification is still relevant and will be accepted as a validation of Terraform knowledge until each individual badgeâ€™s expiration date. Receiving a Terraform Associate 003 certification will not impact any existing Terraform Associate 002 credentials, and a single candidate can hold both at the same time. However, either certification alone can be used to validate Terraform knowledge at the associate level.

- **If you have passed the Terraform Associate 002 exam**, wait until the new version comes out to recertify. We have extended all current badge expirations dates so you have time to wait for the new exam.
- **If you have never passed the Terraform Associate exam**, the choice is up to you and your timeline.

**Content Differences Between Exams**

We've updated the Terraform Associate 003 exam to account for how Terraform has grown, and to accommodate future growth. The changes are primarily a reorganization and rewording of the 002 exam objectives. More significant changes are listed below.
