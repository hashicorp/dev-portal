## Exam Availability

Coming in May 2024.

## Which Exam to Take

You can use either exam to validate Consul knowledge at the associate level. The [Consul Associate 002 certification](/certifications/networking-automation#consul-associate-002-details) is still relevant and will be accepted as validation of Consul knowledge until the badgeâ€™s expiration date. You can hold both the Consul Associate 002 and Consul Associate 003 at the same time.

**If you have studied for Consul Associate 002 and are prepared to take it now,** schedule and take the 002 exam before April 30.

**If you are not ready to schedule and take the exam,** we advise studying for Consul Associate 003 and taking it in May 2024.
