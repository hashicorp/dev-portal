## Renewing Your Certification

To renew any Consul Associate certification, you will need to take and pass the new Consul Associate 003 exam.

**If you hold an *unexpired* Consul Associate 002 certification:** You can take the new (003) exam starting 18 months after your previous exam date. When you pass the Consul Associate 003 exam to recertify, you will receive a new, separate set of credentials (badge and corresponding certificate) that will reflect your recertification date. The date of your credentials related to your Consul Associate 002 certification will not be updated.

**If you hold an *unexpired* Consul Associate 003 certification:** You can take the new exam starting 18 months after your previous exam date. When you pass the new exam, the expiration date on your credentials will be extended.

**If you hold any *expired* Consul Associate certification:** You are eligible to recertify at any time. When you pass the new exam, you will receive a new, separate set of credentials with a new expiration date.
