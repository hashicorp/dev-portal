## Who should take this exam 

You should take the Consul Associate certification exam if you are a Cloud Engineer with foundational Consul knowledge and skills, who can identify Consul Enterprise features and distinguish them from Community Edition. You may be a site reliability engineer, solutions architect, or other DevOps professional.  

You have a fundamental understanding of these topics:  

- Containerization 
- Terminal skills 
- Load balancing architecture 
- Distributed systems  
- Security practices  
- OSI Model familiarity 
- Cloud & Platform awareness (AWS, Google, Azure, Kubernetes, VMs) 

While professional experience is recommended, you can also prepare by practicing the exam objectives in a personal demo setup.
