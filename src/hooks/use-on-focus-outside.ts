 *
 * Listens for `focusin` events by default, but this can be disabled by passing
 * `false` for the `shouldListen` parameter.
 *
 * Note: `shouldListen` is particularly useful when this hook is used in
 * components that manage an open/closed state. Passing `false` for
 * `shouldListen` when these types of components are in a closed state, and
 * `focusin` events don't need to be listened to, prevents adding
 * unnecessary event listeners to the document.
