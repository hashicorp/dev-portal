| Praise 🙌    | Use to highlight something positive. It's nice to try to leave one per review, but don't leave false praise just to leave one of these comments.                                                                                                             |
| Question 🙋  | Use to gain clarity from the code author. The conversation could evolve into any one of these other categories. Only the reviewer should resolve these comment threads.                                                                                      |
| Thought 💭   | Use to share context, leave a breadcrumb, or share an idea that came up while reviewing.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Blocker 🚧   | Use to request changes that block merging the current PR. Only the reviewer should resolve these comment threads.                                                                                                                                            |
| Future 📌    | Use to request changes that the code author can choose to address in the current PR or a follow-up one.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Optional 🎨  | Use to suggest optional changes that you feel strongly about but ultimately defer to the code author to make a decision on. These can be comments that turn into valuable conversation starters for adopting new code styles, guidelines, or team practices. |
| Nitpick ⛏️   | Use to suggest changes based on loose opinions or personal preferences. The difference between this and **Optional** 🎨  is how strong the code reviewer's opinion is.                                                                                       |
