name: Redeploy Content Repo Previews

# When the dev-portal/main branch is pushed to, redeploy the `main` branches of
# the listed docs content repositories. The redeploys are triggered through a
# Deploy Hook created for each repository's Vercel project. These can be found
# in the Git settings within the Vercel project.
#
# For consistency and traceability, each new secret should be named using the
# following convention:
#
#   VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_<vercel-project-slug>
#
# And new Deploy Hooks should be named:
#
#   "Re-deploy when dev-portal/main updates"
#
