/**
 * # Some notes on rewrites
 *
 * ## Why this approach works
 *
 * ### "beforeFiles"
 *
 * We run our rewrites "beforeFile". This makes it so
 * NextJS does the rewrite even if it has a page file to serve.
 * We do this because we have conflicting pages, such as:
 * - "/" (should show eg /_proxied-dot-io/waypoint/, even though there may be a dev-portal landing page defined at this route)
 * - "/security" (should show eg /proxied-dot-io/waypoint/security, even though there may be a dev-portal security page defined at this route)
 *
 * ref: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites
 *
 * ## Explicit rewrites
 *
 * We current have explicit rewrites for all
 * proxied dot-io pages.
 *
 * The reason for this is that regex approaches seemed
 * to consistently cause problems. Specifically:
 *
 * - Using "/:path*" without "beforeFiles"
 *   (ie default "afterFiles") means we don't
 *   resolve the conflicts mentioned above,
 *   in the "beforeFiles" section, as expected.
 *
 * - Using "/:path*" or "/:path+" with "beforeFiles"
 *   end up rewriting all `/_next/` assets.
 *   This breaks the page.
 *
